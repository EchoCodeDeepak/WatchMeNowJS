This HTML and JavaScript code creates a webpage named "WatchMeNowJS" that displays a real-time clock with start and stop options. The clock is initially set to "Hi," and it updates every second to show the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

The HTML file includes references to external stylesheets ("style.css" and "bootstrap.min.css") and a JavaScript file ("script.js"). The body of the page has a container with a heading ("Hi") and two buttons ("Start" and "Stop") arranged in a row.

The JavaScript code defines a setInterval function that updates the clock's text content every second with the current time. Additionally, there are two functions, StartWatch() and stopWatch(), which start and stop the clock by clearing the interval, respectively.

The code seems to be related to a GitHub repository for a real-time clock with start and stop options. It provides a simple and interactive way to display and control a clock on a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
